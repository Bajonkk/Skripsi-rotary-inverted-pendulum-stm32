This file contains code I use for my bachelor thesis, titled:
"Modeling, Design, and Implementation of a Rotary Inverted Pendulum System Based on STM32 Microcontroller Using PID and LQR Controller"
The project mainly around building a self-made rotary inverted pendulum system on STM32 microcontroller. I'll add link below to my thesis file and also a youtube video of my explanation on control theory implementation on RIP systems
